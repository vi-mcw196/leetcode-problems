## Summary

- Binary Search is a searching algorithm for finding an element's position in a sorted array.
- In this approach, the element is always searched in the middle of a portion of an array.
- Binary search can be implemented only on a sorted list of items. If the elements are not sorted already, we need to sort them first.

##Binary Search Complexity
###Time Complexities

- Best case complexity: O(1)
- Average case complexity: O(log n)
- Worst case complexity: O(log n)

###Space Complexity
The space complexity of the binary search is O(1).
